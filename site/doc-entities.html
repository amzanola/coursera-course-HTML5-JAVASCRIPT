			&quot;"There's another HTML entity reference that is very commonly 
			used and unfortunately, a lot of time misused as well. Let's 
			say for example that in the last sentence here that ends timid 
			souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Let's say we wanted 
			the words victory nor defeat never to wrap, but always stay the 
			same. So, what do I mean by that? Let me pull the browser and 
			make it a little bit less wide. And as you can see, the word 
			victory nor defeat is split up into different lines. Let's say 
			I didn't want that. For whatever visual reason I wanted the 
			words victory nor defeat to always stay the same. So if it is 
			going to wrap, it should either not wrap at all or wrap all 
			together. Well, the way you do that is with a non-breaking space. 
			And the way you use it is nbsp;. Not breaking space, or removing 
			all spaces&nbsp;between&nbsp;the&nbsp;words."&quot;
